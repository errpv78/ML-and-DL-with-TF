# ML-and-DL-with-TF
Machine learning and deep learning algorithms and techniques using tensorflow and sklearn

### Regression_Analysis:
Full linear regression ml journey, with data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, algorithm implementation, model comparison, and feature selection.<br>
Linear regression and Random Forest regressor performance evaluation, comparison and feature selection on california housing prces dataset.<br>
Conclusion: Random Forest Regressor with only 4 features out of 8 performed better.


### Batch_Normalization_CNN:
CNN Model performance evaluation with different activation functions and effect of batch normalization.<br>
CNN model for fashion mnist data, and comparison of relu and sigmoid activation functions with added effect of batch normalization.<br>
Conclusion: Batch Normalization improved performance for both activation functions and Relu performed better.<br>


### RNN:
Simple RNN for addition using strings as inputs.<br>


### Deepfake_with_keras:
Implementation of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DcGan) for fenerating synthetic images of numbers(0-9) by traing the GAN on mnist data.<br>
